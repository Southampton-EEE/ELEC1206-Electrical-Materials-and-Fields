# `ELEC1206` Electrical Materials and Fields

This is a repository to share and compile notes for the ELEC1206
module.

For each lecture there should be a folder containing a markdown
document, and any additional content (images, slides etc.).

It is important that you edit the notes already present, rather than
just uploading your notes.

Please use `git` correctly, forking the repository before making a 
pull request to get your content added.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to email the administrator,
